\item \textbf{Definitions}

\begin{longenum} [label*=\arabic*., align=left]
	
\item \textbf{Requisitioner}: The Society of Graduate Students.

\item \textbf{Requisitioning Committee:} The committee which prepares a procurement process and reviews bidder submissions as appropriate. Certain contracts (outlined below) require a particular Society Committee to serve as the Requisitioning Committee.
\end{longenum}

\item \textbf{Scope} \newline
This policy applies to the purchase of:
\begin{longenum} [label*=\arabic*., align=left]

	\item Goods and services estimated in excess of \$5,000 excluding taxes and/or shipping costs;
	\item Goods and services of any price as determined at the discretion of council; 
	\item Goods and services identified in a competitive bid from a supplier;
	\item Goods and services requiring a "request for quotation" or "tender" as deemed necessary by government, university or contractual obligation.
	\item The extension or renewal of any exciting contracts for goods as described above unless explicitly excluded in this policy.
	
	\item Existing Contracts: \newline
	New bids are not required for the acquisition of goods and services covered by an existing Society contract. Should a Requisitioner choose not to use a supplier already under contract, the appropriate bid process must be followed.
	
	\item Exclusions: \newline
	Goods purchased for external resale; and
	Goods and services valued up to and including \$5,000 not addressed by the inclusion rules above.

\end{longenum}

\item \textbf{Competitive Bid Requirements}
\begin{longenum} [label*=\arabic*., align=left]
	\item It is the responsibility of the Requisitioner to ensure all purchases requiring competitive bids are compliant with the following:
		\begin{longenum} [label*=\arabic*., align=left]
	\item Prices must be sought from at least three (3) sources;
	\item Wherever possible efforts should be made to seek at least one (1) bid from a non-profit, not-for-profit or cooperative vendor;
	\item Price quotations must be obtained using the method appropriate to the complexity and estimated cost of the good or service under consideration as described below.
\end{longenum}	
\end{longenum}

\item \textbf{Sole Source}
\begin{longenum} [label*=\arabic*., align=left]
	\item The competitive bid requirement is waived for the purchase of those goods and services only available from one (1) lone supplier. An example of a sole source contract is the London Transit Commission Student Bus Pass agreement.

\end{longenum}

\item \textbf{Price Quotation}

\begin{longenum} [label*=\arabic*., align=left]
		\item For purchases of \$5,001-\$50,000, price quotations must be solicited by the Requisitioner by phone, fax or e-mail. Price quotations must be documented (including award justification) by the Requisitioning Committee or the Executive, as appropriate. The Requisitioner may contact the suppliers directly or enlist the assistance of the University of Western Ontario's Purchasing Unit.
		
\end{longenum}

\item \textbf{Request for Quotation (RFQ)}

\begin{longenum} [label*=\arabic*., align=left]

Suppliers' responses must be sealed and forwarded through the Society's Office to the Requisitioner, with attention to the Society's President and Official Liaison to the Requisitioning Committee.
		
	\item	Stamped with the date and time of receipt at the Society's office, bid documents are opened only after the deadline has expired (according to the process outlined in Opening of Bids). The Requisitioning Committee evaluates the tenders and selects the bid for recommendation/approval that best meets the selection criteria.

\end{longenum}
\item	In any situations where the Requisitioning Committee has agreed to mandatory or rated criteria that will be used to evaluate submissions, these criteria must be clearly outlined including weight of each criterion.

\end{longenum}


\item \textbf{Evaluation and Award}

\begin{longenum} [label*=\arabic*., align=left]
		\item All quotations and requests are created and reviewed by a committee consisting of at least one representative from the Executive, members of the Requisitioning Committee, as well as one (1) non-voting member of the Society's office staff retained to advise on historical precedents.

\end{longenum}


\item \textbf{Vendor Protests}
\begin{longenum} [label*=\arabic*., align=left]


\item The Society is responsible for maintaining a bidding process that is fair and equitable to all interested parties. If a supplier believes the bidding process has been compromised, the bidder is invited to contact the Society for possible investigation according to the parameters outlined below:

\item Suppliers must submit a written protest within five (5) days of learning information applicable to the protest.

\item Once the grievance is filed, the Requisitioner, the Executive, and the Ombudsperson shall be notified. Collectively, these parties decide if the procurement should continue.

\item If the contract is not yet awarded, it may be held until the review is complete, except in circumstances in which delaying awarding the contract would substantially damage the Society and/or its membership.

\item For contracts already awarded, the Requisitioner notifies the supplier awarded the bid and if deemed possible and necessary, may be asked to stop or hold the purchase until the review is complete. When appropriate or necessary, legal counsel is consulted.

\item Before making a determination on a vendor protest, the Executive, the Speaker, the Ombudsperson, the chair of the Requisitioning Committee, and if necessary legal counsel, shall engage in a consultative process to review the available information and evidence. After reviewing the information gathered, the President shall issue a written determination to all involved parties.
\end{longenum}
