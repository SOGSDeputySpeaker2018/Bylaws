			\item Discussion with any and all of the moderation team that is currently online;

					\end{longenum}	
				\end{longenum}

				\end{longenum}	
			\item A warning must be logged with "Dyno," a moderation bot on the server;
				\begin{longenum}[label*=\arabic*., align=left]
				\item To do so, type "?warn [user] [reason]" in \#bot-logs or \#mods. Doing so will send a message to the user through Dyno;

			\item A "verbal reprimand may be given in the channel where the offence occurred, or by Direct Message, at the discretion of the moderation team.
				\begin{longenum}[label*=\arabic*., align=left]
				\item The moderation team should also use "?warn [user] [reason]" in this instance. Note that the bot, Dyno, will send a message to the user indicating that they were warned.
				\end{longenum}	
			\item To global mute a user, use the "tempo soft ban" role and the "?mute [user] [time limit] [reason]" command in \#bot-logs or \#mods.
				\begin{longenum}[label*=\arabic*., align=left]
				\item Note that if the mute command is used, there are some channels that have override permissions, and this is not a Global Mute;
				\item Likewise, note that if a user has individual permissions in a channel (for example, \#pride), the "temp soft ban" role does not mute them in these channels;
				\item Be sure to log the mute with the "?note [user] [reason]" command;
				\item A moderator may use the command "?temprole [use] temp soft ban [time limit]" to automatically give and remove the role after a certain amount of time.

				\end{longenum}

			\end{longenum}	
		\item Any moderation discussion shall be accompanied by documentation. This documentation shall include, at minimum:
			\begin{longenum}[label*=\arabic*., align=left]
			\item The name of the Moderator(s) involved;
			\item The user account the action was taken against;
			\item The reason for the enforcement;
			\item The reprimand given and the actions taken by the moderator(s), if any;
			\item Screen captures of the offence, before removal and/or of the \#bot-logs of the removal; and
			\item A summary of moderator/admin discussion that resulted in the discipline chosen;
			\item This documentation must be posted in the \#mod-logs channel.
			\end{longenum}	
		\end{longenum}	
	\item The server rules are as follows:
		\begin{longenum}[label*=\arabic*., align=left]	
			\item No hate speech on any topics including but not limited to: race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, etc. Any racial/hateful/offensive slurs posted on this server will result in an immediate and permanent ban.
			\item Please refrain from posting or talking about any of the following items in our text channels or voice channels: Racism, Sexism, NSFW Material, Personal Information (yours or another's) that people should not know about, direct insults, and please: no spam.
			\item As in any SOGS setting: belittling, verbally attacking, or being overly rude or mean to others will not be tolerated. The demeaning of others has no place here in this server and we will not approve of that kind of behaviour. Show respect to others even if they do not respect you in return.
			\item No harassment on this server or in DMs. This includes unwanted sexual advances, ghost pinging, excessive messaging, etc. If you have received unwanted DMs, please contact an Administrator or Moderator.
			\item Impersonating, willfully or otherwise, is not tolerated in this space. SOGS respects each user's right to remain anonymous. But any username that could be construed as a "real name" must be changed to something that is obvious to be an anonymous nickname. Movie/Book character names are allowed. You may be asked to change your name if it seems to violate this rule.
			\item Attempting to circumvent sanctions, e.g., by use of alt accounts, can result in being kicked out or permanently banned from the server.
			\item Please be courteous of others and avoid spamming "@" commands unless needed.
			\item For general hangouts and conversation use \#coffee-shop. You can post about any topic here. Think of this like a chat room where people can hold text-chat conversations while hanging out together.
			\item Please use appropriate text and voice channels when discussing a topic. The reason we have so many channels is to allow members to filter what they do and do not want to see. World events can be stressful, so please respect others' abilities to choose what content to consume. Note: you can "mute" a channel if you do not wish to see notifications: right click on the channel > Mute Channel > Until I turn it back on.
			\item Debate channels are less-moderated ("low mod"). Please keep discussion civil and attack the idea, not the person. These channels are for debate, and can get heated. Please be aware of this before reading or using the following channels: \#world-politics, and \#sogs-chat.
			\item If you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions please do not hesitate to contact any of the @admin team, or a @moderator if no admin is online.
			\item Please note that this server is subject to SOGS's Discipline Code (our Code of Conduct - Policy 3.2. in the Unified Documents), as well as SOGS' Orientation and Social Committee Policy Document.			
			\item Dislcaimer: Please know you are navigating this environment at your own risk; SOGS trusts that the community will be respectful adults and use this space appropriately. We do have a moderation team, but we cannot guarantee that a moderator will always be online or able to moderate at the speed the chat is flowing.
